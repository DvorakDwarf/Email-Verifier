# Email-Verifier
A simple discord bot I made for a conference's discord server to hand out access only to people with the correct email. A user DMs the bot with $verify [their email] and the bot looks for them in emails.csv and gives them a specific role on your server. I made it send a verification email with a personalised code as well. If you want me to upload that version or you want to use the bot but something is broken, contact me (preferrably over discord).

The emails in the file by default are fake btw.
